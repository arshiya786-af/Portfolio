Setup
If you installed git you can clone the code to your machine, or download a ZIP of all the files directly.

Download the ZIP from this location, or run the following git command to clone the files to your machine:

git clone https://github.com/craigshoemaker/html-css-javascript-getting-started
Once the files are on your machine, open the html-css-javascript-getting-started folder in Visual Studio Code.
